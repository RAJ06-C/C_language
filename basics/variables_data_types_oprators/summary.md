# 🧠 Variables and Data Types in C

Variables and data types are the foundation of any programming language, and C is no exception.  
Understanding how data is stored, accessed, and manipulated is essential for writing efficient C programs.

---

## 🧾 What is a Variable?

A **variable** in C is a named memory location that stores a value.  
You can think of a variable as a container for data that can change during program execution.

### 🔹 Example:
```c
int age = 20;
float height = 5.9;
char grade = 'A';

```
---
## ⚙️ Rules for Naming Variables

* ** Variable names can contain letters (A-Z, a-z), digits (0-9), and underscore (\_).**
* **The first character must be a letter or underscore, not a digit.**
* **C is case-sensitive, so `total` and `Total` are different variables.**
* **Variable names cannot be C keywords (like `int`, `return`, `float`).**
* **There should be no spaces or special characters like @, $, % in variable names.**

---

### 📦 What are Data Types?

**A data type defines the type of data a variable can hold, such as:**

* **Integers** (whole numbers)
* **Floating-point numbers**
* **Characters**
* **Derived types** like arrays, structures, etc.

# Data Types in C

Each **variable in C** has an associated **data type**. It specifies the type of data that the variable can store, like integer, character, floating-point, double, etc.

**Example:**

```c
int number;
```
![datatypes](data_type_in_c.webp "DATA TYPES IN C")

# Integer Data Type in C

The **integer datatype** in C is used to store whole numbers (any number including positive, negative, and zero) **without a decimal part**. Octal values, hexadecimal values, and decimal values can also be stored in the `int` data type.

| Feature              | Details                                      |
| :------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| **Range**            | -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647              |
| **Size**             | 4 bytes                                      |
| **Format Specifier** | `%d` (used for printing and scanning values) |

**Example Declaration:**

We use the `int` keyword to declare the integer variable:

```c
int val;

```

---

A variable of a given data type can only contain **values of the same type**. For example, if you declare an integer variable, it can only store numbers, not text or anything else.

---
## Integer Data Type Modifiers (Variations)
---

The basic integer data type (`int`) can be modified using keywords to change its range and size.

| Modifier                 | Description                                                                               | Typical Size & Range        |
| :----------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------- |
| **`unsigned int`**       | Stores data values from zero to positive numbers, but **cannot store negative values**.   | 4 bytes; 0 to 4,294,967,295 |
| **`short int`**          | Typically **lesser in size** (by 2 bytes) than a standard `int`.                          | 2 bytes; -32,768 to 32,767  |
| **`long int`**           | A **larger version** of the `int` datatype, capable of storing values greater than `int`. | 4 or 8 bytes; Larger range  |
| **`unsigned short int`** | Similar in relationship with `short int` as `unsigned int` is with `int`.                 | 2 bytes; 0 to 65,535        |

---

**Note on Size:**

The size of an integer data type is **compiler dependent**. We can use the `sizeof` operator to check the actual size of any data type on your specific system. The sizes mentioned above are typically observed on modern 64-bit compilers.


# Character Data Type (`char`)

The **Character data type** (`char`) allows its variable to store only a **single character**.

It is the most basic data type in C. It stores a single character and requires a single byte of memory in almost all compilers.

| Feature | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Range** | (-128 to 127) or (0 to 255) |
| **Size** | 1 byte |
| **Format Specifier** | `%c` |

# Floating-Point Data Types in C

C provides two main data types for storing real numbers (numbers with a fractional or decimal part): `float` and `double`.

## 1. Float Data Type (`float`)

The `float` data type is used to store **single precision** floating-point values. These values can be decimal and exponential numbers.

| Feature | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Precision** | Single Precision |
| **Range** | 1.2E-38 to 3.4E+38 |
| **Size** | 4 bytes |
| **Format Specifier** | `%f` |

---

## 2. Double Data Type (`double`)

The `double` data type is used to store decimal numbers (numbers with floating point values) with **double precision**. It offers higher precision and a larger range than `float`.

It can easily accommodate about 16 to 17 digits after or before a decimal point.

| Feature | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Precision** | Double Precision |
| **Range** | 1.7E-308 to 1.7E+308 |
| **Size** | 8 bytes |
| **Format Specifier** | `%lf` |

# Constants in C Programming

---

In C programming, **constants** are fixed values that **cannot be altered** during the execution of a program. They are also known as **literals** or **read-only variables**. Constants ensure **data integrity** by preventing accidental modifications of important values.

There are two primary ways to define constants in C:

---

## 1. Using the `const` keyword

The `const` keyword declares a variable as constant, meaning its value cannot be changed after initialization.

**Example:**

```c
const int myConstant = 10;
const float PI = 3.14159;

```
---

## 2. Using the #define preprocessor directive

This directive defines `symbolic constants`, which are essentially text substitutions performed by the `preprocessor` before compilation.

***Example***
```c
#define MAX_SIZE 100
#define GREETING "Hello, World!"

```
When the program is compiled, every instance of `MAX_SIZE` will be replaced with `100`, and `GREETING` with `"Hello, World!"`

# Type Conversion and Type Casting in C

---

In C programming, **type conversion** and **type casting** refer to the process of changing a value from one data type to another. These concepts are crucial for managing data types in expressions and ensuring correct calculations.

## 1. Type Conversion (Implicit Type Conversion / Coercion)

This type of conversion is performed **automatically by the compiler** without any explicit instruction from the programmer.

It generally occurs in situations where the compiler can safely convert one data type to another without potential data loss, or when performing operations involving mixed data types.

**Example:**

When an **integer** is added to a **float**, the integer is **implicitly converted to a float** before the addition takes place, and the result will be a float.

```c
int num = 10;
float value = 5.5;
float result = num + value; // 'num' is implicitly converted to 10.0f
```
# Type Casting (Explicit Type Conversion)

**Type casting** is performed **explicitly by the programmer** using the **cast operator**.

This is necessary when the conversion might involve potential data loss (e.g., converting a `float` to an `int`), or when the programmer wants to explicitly control the type of an expression.

### Syntax:

# ⚙️ Operator Precedence and Associativity in C

In C programming, expressions can contain multiple operators such as `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `=`, and many others.  
To correctly evaluate such expressions, **C follows specific rules** known as **operator precedence** and **associativity**.

---

## 🧠 What is Operator Precedence?

**Operator precedence** determines **which operation is performed first** in an expression that contains more than one operator.

If two operators appear in an expression, the one with **higher precedence** is evaluated first.

---

### 🧩 Example:
```c
int result = 10 + 20 * 30;
```
---

## 🔄 What is Associativity?

When two or more operators have the **same precedence**, the associativity of the operators determines the **order of evaluation** — either from ***left to right*** or **right to left**.

### 🧩 Example:

```c
int result = 100 / 10 * 5;
```
Both `/` and `*` have the same precedence.
So how does C decide which to evaluate first?

# ⚙️ Operations in C

## 📘 Introduction
In the C programming language, **operations** are performed using **operators** and **operands**.  
An **operator** is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform a specific mathematical or logical operation,  
while an **operand** is the data or variable on which the operator acts.

For example:
```c
int result = a + b;
```

##    🔼 Increment and Decrement Operations

| **Operator** | **Meaning** | **Example**    | **Explanation**      |
| ------------ | ----------- | -------------- | -------------------- |
| `++`         | Increment   | `++a` or `a++` | Increases value by 1 |
| `--`         | Decrement   | `--a` or `a--` | Decreases value by 1 |


- **📝 Note:**

   - 1) ++a (pre-increment) → Increases first, then uses the value.

    - 2) a++ (post-increment) → Uses the value, then increases.

##  🧩 Miscellaneous Operations

| **Operator** | **Meaning**                             | **Example**                              |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `sizeof`     | Returns size of a variable or data type | `sizeof(int)`                            |
| `&`          | Address of operator                     | `&a` gives memory address of `a`         |
| `*`          | Pointer dereference                     | `*ptr` gives value at address            |
| `(type)`     | Type casting                            | `(float)a` converts integer `a` to float |
